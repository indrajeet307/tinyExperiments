BlinkC.nc	is the implementaion file
BlinkAppC.nc	is the configuration file
Generic Components	can be instansiated more than once
Non Generic Components	can be instansiated only once

Modules
States

Interfaces types:					
Commands					==	use CALL keyword to invoke the interface function they are synchronus
Events						==	use SIGNAL keyword to invoke the interfaced function

Execution Models:
Tasks						== use POST keyword to invoke the tasks, they are asynchronus
								a task queue is maintained internally, which is processed in FIFO manner

Internal Funcations

Split-Phase Operations		== does not tie up the stack
							== keeps system responsive
							== reduces stack burden
							== parallel execution
							== makes the implementaion verbose
